Hi, I'm Naturelord (aka Blake Patton )

I'm a Software Engineer two years in the field now as of (2/22). My main role right now is in GPU and image processing techniqeus. But other passions I have include
open source AI development, the increasing compute power of hardware and the different re-emerging tech ( think Analog Computing ), and the mystery of where technology
is developing.

I'm currently teaching myself Unreal Engine 5, C++ 20/23 Features, and Software Design Principles.

Looking too collaborate on some documentation for some projects that interest me to get my feet wet with open source development and help teach myself the different
design principles that I myself might one day use.

If I've done something to impress my email is: blakepatton13@gmail.com , otherwise if I cost your company millions due to a bad commit. Please reference : itwaspaul@gmail.com

Enjoy your day!
